# Unity Project Core
This Asset was created to help you quickly start developing any projects on Unity. It contains the most popular folders such as:
* Scripts
* Images
* Materials

etc

You do not have to create them every time you create a project!
We have added a control system based on Actions using the "state" pattern.
Added TMPro and 1 generated font instead of the usual one.
The order of adding our asset to your project:
- Create a project and clean it up.

- Import our package.

Here we go!
